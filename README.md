EdgeFiles
=========
<p>
CMS has announced the XML file layouts for Health Insurance Marketplace Edge Server. This C# project will take the raw enrollment, pharmacy claims, and medical claims data and generate output in the Edge Server format. The participation into this project is open to all issuers who are in need of these XML files. Development is being done under the GNU General Public License.
</p>

Project Overview
=========
<p>The EdgeFiles API allows issuers to easily gather their data for EDGE server submissions and then submit this data to the API to get an XML file in return. The XML file that is returned is in the format needed for the EDGE server and can be submitted with no further modification needed. This API needs to be hosted by the issuer who intends to use it.</p>

<p>Please take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/AultCare/EdgeFiles/wiki">wiki</a> for more information about how to use this project.</p>
